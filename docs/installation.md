### Instructions

You can download BRAW Toolbox from the Mac App Store.

> [:icon-desktop-download: **Click here to buy on the Mac App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/braw-toolbox/id6444061549?mt=12)

When you run it for the first time, you'll be presented with this:

If it's the first time installing the software, or if there's been an update, you'll be prompted to **Install Motion Templates**, **Install Metadata View** and **Install LUTs**.

> **IMPORTANT:** You should make sure that Final Cut Pro is not running at this point.

Once you click **Install Motion Templates**, you'll be prompted to grant permission to your Movies folder. This is due to macOS's sandboxing, and you'll only need to do this once. Click **OK**.

You then need to click **Grant Access**:

Once done, you'll be presented with a successful message:

After clicking **OK**, the **Install Motion Templates** button will now be disabled, and will instead say **Motion Templates Installed**.

You should now click the **Install Metadata View** button, and you'll be prompted to grant permission to your ProApps folder. Click **OK** again:

You need to click the **Grant Access** button:

Once done, you'll be presented with a successful message:

The **Install Metadata View** button will now be disabled, and will say **Metadata View Installed**.

You now need to click the **Install LUTs** button. LUTs are stored in the same root folder as the Metadata View's, so you don't need to grant it permission again.

After clicking the button you'll be presented with a successful message:

After clicking **OK**, you can now click **Launch Final Cut Pro**, which will close the BRAW Toolbox application and Launch Final Cut Pro.

> **IMPORTANT:** You should run the BRAW Toolbox application again after each update, to make sure you're using the latest Motion Templates, Metadata View, and LUTs.
