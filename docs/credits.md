BRAW Toolbox has been thrown together by [Chris Hocking](https://github.com/latenitefilms) at [LateNite Films](https://latenitefilms.com).

Chris also created [CommandPost](https://commandpost.io) and [Gyroflow Toolbox](https://github.com/latenitefilms/GyroflowToolbox).

The BRAW Toolbox icon was designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](http://matthewskiles.com).

The incredible surf footage (as seen in the above screenshots) was captured by Sydney based Director/Cinematographer, [Adrian Emerton](https://www.adrianemerton.com.au).
