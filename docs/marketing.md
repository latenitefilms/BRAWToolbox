He was the lighting designer for the Moscow Circus tours in South Africa & Taiwan, as well as lighting some of Sony Music’s biggest artists. He was previously the Post Production Supervisor at Melbourne’s award winning editing house The Butchery, and finishing house The Refinery - where he oversaw thousands of high-end commercials, and several short films, feature films and documentaries.

Chris has an incredibly strong and varied technical and business background, and takes care of the day-to-day operations at LateNite Films – ensuring that each production makes use of the best and most relevant technology and workflows. His producing credits include the SBS2 series The Wizards of Aus, the Melbourne based Fairy Tale unit on the Foxtel mini series The Lambs of God, a number of music videos for artists including Peking Duk, Cosmo’s Midnight, Rufus du Sol, American Doubles, Casey Donovan and Guy Pearce and the ABC ME project The Legend of Burnout Barry.

### About BRAW Toolbox

BRAW Toolbox allows you to import Blackmagic RAW files directly into Final Cut Pro without transcoding.

No more transcoding. No more waiting. No more massive ProRes files.

The BRAW Toolbox Workflow Extension allows you to prepare all your footage prior to import, allowing you to easily and quickly change all the RAW metadata, and copy and paste metadata from different BRAW clips. You can even save Presets for specific Metadata Attributes.

Once imported into Final Cut Pro, you can still modify the RAW metadata at any time - and you can even keyframe the ISO, Exposure, Color Temp and Tint.

BRAW Toolbox comes with a Metadata View that allows you to view every piece of BRAW Metadata directly within the Final Cut Pro Inspector.

There are automatic Decode Quality for both HD and UltraHD projects, and you can also work at a low quality Decode Quality, then apply a "Global Setting" to force Full Quality prior to export. BRAW Toolbox gives you complete freedom and flexibility.

You can also use the Workflow Extension to send your project/timeline to DaVinci Resolve for grading - all using BRAW files directly from the camera!

The BRAW Toolbox icon was designed by the amazing [Matthew Skiles](http://matthewskiles.com).

The incredible surf footage (as seen in the above screenshots) was captured by Sydney based Director/Cinematographer, [Adrian Emerton](https://www.adrianemerton.com.au).
