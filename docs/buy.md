# Buy on Mac App Store

> [:icon-desktop-download: **Click here to buy on the Mac App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/braw-toolbox/id6444061549?mt=12)

**BRAW Toolbox** is a one-time payment of **79.99**.

This is generally **79.99** in your local currency (i.e. **AUD79.99**, **USD79.99**, **CAD79.99**).

However, if your country doesn't have an equivalent of 79.99 (i.e. Rp1299000 in Indonesia), it will default to a **USD$79.99 equivalent**.

There is currently no free trial, and it is only be available on the Mac App Store as a **one-time payment**.

However, we will be posting TestFlight builds prior to updates for the community to test. Keep an eye on our [announcements](https://github.com/latenitefilms/BRAWToolbox/discussions/categories/announcements).

You can find information about Educational Pricing [here](https://brawtoolbox.io/educational/).

Thank you to all our beta testers and early adopters, who were able to purchase BRAW Toolbox for 50% off during the first week of its release!
