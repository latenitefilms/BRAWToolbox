# Release Notes

### 1.2.0 (52)

**🎉 Released:**
- Thursday 15th June 2023

**🔨 Improvements:**

- Added support for Fujifilm X-S20 Blackmagic RAW clips.
- Updated from Blackmagic RAW SDK v3.1 to v3.2.

---

### 1.1.4 (51)

**🎉 Released:**
- Tuesday 13th June 2023

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Thanks to the help and support of the awesome Final Cut Pro team, we finally have a workaround to the Synchronised Clips bug. Previously, Synchronised Clips could cause random glitches during playback, and produce unexpected results in some, but not all, cases. As a result, in BRAW Toolbox v1.1.1 we made **Create Multicam Clips** the default option as a workaround to this issue. We now know this was actually due to the fact that we're applying the BRAW Toolbox effect to a **Custom** Solids Generator. Whilst Final Cut Pro worked correctly when scrubbing and skimming a clip, during playback, because the Custom generator normally doesn't change its output (i.e. it's always a static colour), Final Cut Pro was using a cached frame, rather than rendering a new frame, which caused the glitches. Essentially, it's very unusual for an Effect to change the output of a Generator, so we were getting unpredictable results. We now workaround this issue by simply applying keyframes to the Custom Solid, so that Final Cut Pro always renders the frames - simple, but effective. To fix Synchronized Clips created in earlier versions of BRAW Toolbox, we've added a **Repair Synchronized Clips (prior to v1.1.3)** Toolbox, which will add keyframes to all your Generators within the BRAW Toolbox Clip. HUGE thank you to Tangier Clarke for supplying a reproducible library to help us solve this annoying bug. We'll leave **Create Multicam Clips** on by default, however you will no longer get a warning message when you toggle this preference.

---

### 1.1.3 (50)

**🎉 Released:**
- Monday 5th June 2023

**🔨 Improvements:**

- We've redesigned our re-linking toolbox, and renamed it "Relink BRAW Clips within an LIBRARY / EVENT / PROJECT". You can now relink libraries, events and projects! Thanks for your on-going help and support Tangier Clarke!
- We've improved the error messaging in Final Cut Pro when a BRAW Toolbox clip is offline.

---

### 1.1.2 (49)

**🎉 Released:**
- 25th May 2023

**🔨 Improvements:**

- Added support for Panasonic LUMIX S5II and S5IIX Blackmagic RAW clips.
- Updated from Blackmagic RAW SDK v3.0 to v3.1.

---

### 1.1.1 (48)

**🎉 Released:**
- 9th May 2023

**🔨 Improvements:**
- **Create Multicam Clips** is now enabled by default. When disabling this setting, you're now also presented with some warning information. This is due to a bug in Final Cut Pro 10.6.5 that sometimes incorrectly plays the wrong frames in Synchronised Clips. We now recommend always using Multicam Clips, unless you're planning to create new Multicam Clips by either manually creating them in Final Cut Pro, or using a third-party tool such as Sync-N-Link.

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed a bug introduced in v1.1.0 where error messages are incorrectly flipped vertically.

---

### 1.1.0 (47)

**🎉 Released:**
- 18th April 2023

**🔨 Improvements:**
- Added support for Blackmagic URSA Mini Pro 12K OLPF.

- Updated from Blackmagic RAW SDK v2.8 to v3.0.

---

### 1.0.8 (46)

**🎉 Released:**
- 10th April 2023

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed a bug in the main installation application where the **Install LUTs** button could fail in certain circumstances. Thanks for reporting Tangier Clarke!
- We now use a different method to detect the users home directory, to workaround a rare case where the home directory is different than what macOS reports due to a previous macOS installation. Thanks for reporting Kevin Lyons!

---

### 1.0.7 (45)

**🎉 Released:**
- 9th April 2023

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed a bug where the **Show Parameters** button wouldn't do anything if a BRAW clip's security-scope bookmark could not be resolved. This could happen if you were using the "Grant Sandbox Access" to access a BRAW clip. Thanks for reporting Tangier Clarke!

---

### 1.0.6 (44)

**🎉 Released:**
- 2nd March 2023

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed a maths rounding bug, where clips could occasionally show two duplicate frames. Thanks for reporting Leigh Emmerson!

---

### 1.0.5 (39)

**🎉 Released:**
- 28th February 2023

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- Fixed a sandboxing issue where the BRAW Toolbox Workflow Extension didn't have read access to sidecar files. Thanks for reporting Uli Plank!
- Fixed a sandboxing issue where the BRAW Toolbox Workflow Extension and FxPlug4 Renderer didn't have read access to spanned BRAW clips. Thanks for reporting Big Emus!
- The BRAW Toolbox Wrapper application no longer requests Owner Rank for BRAW files. Thanks for reporting Uli Plank!

### 1.0.3 (37)

**🎉 Released:**
- 15th February 2023

**🔨 Improvements:**
- We now show Packages (such as a Final Cut Pro Library) as ordinary folders in the **Import BRAW Files** and **Choose Audio Folder** open panels. This allows you to more easily keep your BRAW files and audio files within a Final Cut Pro Library, for easy media management.

- We now default to using Dual Mono Audio instead of Stereo. Thanks Marks07-stack!
- Add setting to **Change Import Event Name** in the Workflow Extension. Thanks George Elias!
- If you press play and change clips in the Workflow Extension, we now continue playing. Thanks Daniel Horvath!
- You can now use the **J** and **L** keyboard shortcuts to control the playback speed in the Workflow Extension. Thanks Indigo Film School!
- We have simplified the FCPXML that BRAW Toolbox generates to speed up Final Cut Pro importing BRAW clips.
- We now use a Bilinear Scale filter instead of a Lanczos Scale filter for processing thumbnails, to speed up Final Cut Pro's thumbnail creation.
- Added a **Reveal in Finder** menu item to the **Global Settings** button in the Final Cut Pro Inspector.
- If you go inside a BRAW Toolbox Synchronised Clip, you'll now see the Generator is labelled "This is just a Custom Solid Generator that contains the BRAW Toolbox effect. Do not cut or trim. You can access the RAW attributes via the BRAW Toolbox effect on this clip." - to help avoid any confusion.

**🐞 Bug Fixes:**
- We've re-engineered how we render BRAW frames, so that we don't use up hundreds or thousands of threads. Thanks to Blackmagic & Apple for all their help solving this!
- We now attempt to render each BRAW frame five times before giving up. This will hopefully reduce the chances of seeing any red error frames.
- Fixed a bug which prevented the **Reset Checked Items** from doing anything. Thanks Iain Anderson!
- The Custom Gamma Selection Checkboxes now enabled/disable correctly when changing the Gamma mode. Thanks Iain Anderson!
- Fixed a bug which caused the Workflow Extension to freeze, when importing **Panasonic S1H** clips that don't have timecode. Thanks for reporting Jamie Nyhan!

**📝 Note:**
- The Motion Templates and Metadata View has been updated in this release. You now also need to install the LUTs when you first run the application (used for HDR).
- We no longer store the Metadata View in the `/Library/Application Support/ProApps/Metadata Definitions/` folder - it's now stored in the user library. You should **manually** delete the `BRAW Toolbox.plist` file in this folder if you've used earlier beta builds.

**🔨 Improvements:**
- We've re-designed the Metal pipeline, to HOPEFULLY improve performance on older 2013 Mac Pro's with Dual AMD FirePro D500. These changes MIGHT also improve performance on other systems. Thanks for reporting [@tangierc](https://github.com/tangierc)!
- Thanks to the amazing Marc Bach & Jamie Lejeune, we've redesigned how BRAW Toolbox handles HDR content, so it better matches DaVinci Resolve.
- There are now **Color Space** settings in the **Settings** button (the gear icon) within the Workflow Extension. This controls the Player in the Workflow Extension, and also the settings of the Synchronised Clips or Multicam Clips that are imported into Final Cut Pro.

**🔨 Improvements:**
- The BRAW Toolbox Motion Template has been completely redesigned to be a lot faster and easier to use. We have removed all the override controls. It now only shows the parameters that you can control (i.e. if your camera doesn't allow manipulating the ISO, we no longer show this parameter).
- We added a **Global Settings** button to the Motion Template in the Final Cut Pro Inspector, so that you can force a Decode Quality across all clips. This is useful if you have clips with different Decode Quality settings, but you want to export at the highest quality.
- We now populate the **Ingest Date** (aka "Date Imported" in Final Cut Pro) metadata field. Thanks for suggesting [@tangierc](https://github.com/tangierc)!

### 1.0.0 (14) - Public Beta 1

**🎉 Released:**
- 23rd December 2022

This is the first public beta of BRAW Toolbox. Woohoo!

This build is very much a work-in-progress, and doesn’t contain all our latest code (due to delays and complexity of getting things approved by Apple’s App Review). However, now that the first beta is out, we hope to be able to push out new builds much more quickly in the New Year, as we work towards a public release.

The main area we’d like to test at this point is making sure that all machines can successfully import and playback BRAW files. Currently we’ve been primarily testing on MacBook Pro’s (16-inch, 2021, M1 Max, 64GB RAM) running macOS Monterey and Final Cut Pro 10.6.5. We're particularly interested to see how things work on MacPro's with multiple GPUs.

The Workflow Extension is currently very incomplete. All of the parameters from Color Science Version onwards currently don’t come across to Final Cut Pro. The buttons at the bottom of the parameters also don’t currently do anything. The Toolbox currently doesn’t do anything.

Happy testing!
