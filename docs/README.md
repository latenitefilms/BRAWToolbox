## Prepare Your Footage

Our Workflow Extension allows you to prepare all your footage prior to import, allowing you to easily and quickly change all the RAW parameters, and copy and paste attributes from different BRAW clips.

You can even save Presets for specific Metadata Attributes.

## Full RAW Control

Once imported into Final Cut Pro, you can still modify the RAW parameters at any time - and you can even keyframe the ISO, Exposure, Color Temp, Tint and Custom Gamma Controls!

There are automatic Decode Quality options for both HD and UltraHD projects, and you can also work at a low quality Decode Quality, then apply a **Global Setting** to force Full Quality prior to export. BRAW Toolbox gives you complete freedom and flexibility.
