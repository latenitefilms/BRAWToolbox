The sandbox’s primary function is to restrict what files an application actually has access to.","For example, an App sold on the Mac App Store generally won't have access to any files on your system, unless you explicitly give it permission. This means it can't mess with your user documents or system files.","Whilst this is fantastic for security reasons - it does provide challenges for apps, such as video editors, which is why Final Cut Pro itself isn't actually sandboxed yet.","When you import clips into the BRAW Toolbox Workflow Extension, you are explicitly giving permission to BRAW Toolbox to access those BRAW files.","Everything works great if you're on a single machine. We use a technology called security-scoped bookmarks to allow us to access any files you've given us permission to access at a later time.","However, when it comes to collaboration it gets a bit more tricky, because those bookmarks are specific to the individual machine.","To solve this, we allow you to Grant Sandbox Access to specific folders, so that the BRAW Toolbox FxPlug4 can read the files without any issues.","You can always Reset Sandbox Access to remove any previously granted permissions.
