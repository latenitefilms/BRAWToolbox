# BRAW Toolbox

BRAW Toolbox allows you to import BRAW files directly into Final Cut Pro without transcoding.

You can currently access the latest build on Apple's TestFlight [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/dbWjWl8e).

BRAW Toolbox is currently closed-source. This repository is used for issue tracking and user help and support.

You can post any issues [here](https://github.com/latenitefilms/BRAWToolbox/issues).

Happy Testing!
